	Password = 360
	Please make a folder in your l4d2 steam directory. (Left 4 Dead 2/left4dead2) you can name it captions. This is so you can convert the caption properly! do not put it in Left 4 Dead 2/left4dead2/resource.
	
	To convert caption, drag the closecaption_russian into the caption.bat
	then drag it into convert.bat
	Unreal created the xbox360 coverter exe, I only made the bat

Extra info

	Make sure L4D2 is in your C drive as well.
	Credits: Papa Quill & @moonpaste
	You can credit both of us in your menu, would be highly appreciated <3
	Also, you can delete russian_subtitles in your zip and all the other language ones you dont need
]

Vxzip
[
	This goes in the vxzip folder in mod tools <3
	
	My recommendation:
	Source games with one zip: [Tf2 for example]
	Zip 0 - leave original files there.
	Zip1 - Modding Zip
	Zip 2 -Texture Zip
	Zip 3  - Overrides [Cosmos Hud for example]
	
	Source games with two zips: [L4d/L4d2 for example]
	Zip 0 - Original
	Zip 1 - Original
	Zip 2 - Modding Zip
	Zip 3 - Textures
	Zip 4 - Overrides
	
	This will make it so you can FTP and compile zips within seconds instead of waiting 8 minutes-
	For compiling a zip and then having to FTP 1 GB+

CosmosFont
[
	Open and install it. For xbox 360, put it in your xbox360 platform folder and NOT the left4dead2.

Please do not use Project Cyanide, as this was a menu that was leaked, and you're basically using stolen code!
I will not help you out if you use Project Cyanide. A lot of the creators weren't happy, and I actually knew the person who made Project Cyanide.
